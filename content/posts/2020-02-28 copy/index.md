ERROR: 
Lucass-MacBook-Pro:my-blog lucasminter$ yarn start
/usr/local/heroku/bin/node: /usr/local/heroku/bin/node: cannot execute binary file

I've tried deleting and reinstalling yarn and heroku via brew but neither worked. 

Now I'm trying to install heroku through heroku's installer on their [website](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)
