I've been studying CSS recently so I can make my blog look a bit more appealing. One of the things I've come across is `margin` and `padding`. I was pretty confused when I saw these cause they seemed to do the same exact thing. Turns out they don't! 

I've come across a few really good examples as well as some pretty funny ones and I wanted to share them.

[pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/creative-professional/whats-difference-margin-padding) has a really good example using a box model which seems to be the easiest way to explain the difference.
