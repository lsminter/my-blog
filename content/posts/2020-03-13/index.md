First of all, what is Gastroparesis? To dumb down Gastroparesis, it is a very rare condition when the stomach cannot empty food normally. This leads to things like nausea, vomiting, heartburn and other symptoms. Food can last in your stomach for days growing harmful bacteria or create a bezoar. The leading cause of Gastroparesis is diabetes that causes damage to the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is what helps to empty your stomach and keeps food moving through the intestines. [Here](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15522-gastroparesis) is a great article on what Gastroparesis is and the symptoms of it.

The biggest thing that should be stated with Gastroparesis is diet. Your diet changes considerably with this condition. You can't have any fatty foods or anything with a significant amount of fiber. This means she can't have food like beef, pork, raw vegetables, fatty fish like tuna or salmon. If she has ground turkey, it has to be very lean, as lean as you can get from your super market or local butcher. So we have a lot of turkey, chicken, rice, and ground bison, which is something surprising that she can actually eat. 

With these restrictions, there are even more restrictions. There are tastes and smells that really can set off her nausea and vomiting. Red sauce, marinara sauce, is the main trigger for her. She can't be in the same room as foods like pizza, red pasta sauce, anything with that is a huge no-go for her. This makes things like parties with friends difficult since pizza is such an easy and available food for big groups. 

What is it like living with Gastroparesis? Well, thankfully I don't have it but my girlfriend, Ashley, has suffered through it for the past few years. She has Idiopathic Gastroparesis, which basically means she doesn't know why she has the condition. She isn't a diabetic and didn't have any surgeries that resulted in damaging her vagus nerve. We've been dating and living together for almost 8 months since the writing of this post and I've been able to view first hand the complications that come with this condition. 

Let me take you through a day in the life of someone with Gastroparesis. Waking up every morning, I don't know how she is going to be that day. Another symptom is exhaustion from not being able to eat as much as she should be able to so sleeping in is normal for her. I ask her almost every morning to see how she is doing. The severity of her nausea varies day to day. Some days, her nausea is very tolerable and she can eat food without worrying, other days, she has trouble keeping down water. Most days, she can only eat one meal and can snack on food for the rest of the day. She doesn't normally eat breakfast so I usually just cook for myself. The days she does feel good, we have things like bagels or I'll make pancakes for the two of us.  

Lunch she normally just snacks, apple sauce with cinnamon is one of her favorites. She is also in love with grilled cheese sandwiches which work for either dinner or lunch. Chicken deli meat on sandwiches is another lunch item she likes to eat on good days. Snacks are chips, ice cream, muffins, things like that. 

Dinner is the meal is most consistently eats. We have things like mac and cheese, grilled cheese, chicken noodle soup are the main ones. We've learned different ways to change common foods into things she can eat. Since she can't have beef for things like burgers, we do turkey or bison burgers. She used to really love beef stroganoff with rice, but we've substituted the beef for ground bison and do it that way. It's a bit for expensive but it helps add variety to her diet and helps her to feel just that much more normal. 

Now that we've gone through meals, let's talk about activities. Before Gastroparesis, she was a huge outdoors person. Since we live in Southern Washington State, there are tons of places to go hiking with your dog. We have a couple of dogs. Kenai is Ashley's emotional support dog. He is a rescue German Shepard mix and is a total sweet heart. My dog is a Jack Russel Terrier and is a total cuddle bug.

While I'm making breakfast, the dogs are cuddling with her in the bed. During the summers she would be hiking almost once a week with Kenai. But now, dealing with the nausea and exhaustion, she has to limit that and we've gone hiking only a couple times the past 8 months. Taking the dogs to the dog park gets difficult for the hard days where getting up and moving around makes her nauseous. Since she can't eat food enough, keeping on body weight gets difficult so she can't workout like she would like to. 


By now, it's pretty obvious that she loves animals. Ashley used to work as an assistant at a veterinary clinic and now works at an animal wholistic retail store called [MudBay](https://www.mudbay.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw3qzzBRDnARIsAECmryrtNaCeNl7h3gryWG66bKK1OIjI4rpLNUrnk1nhpe1P9DbwlfxWfioaAh8IEALw_wcB). She loves working there and all of her coworkers and her boss have helped her out so much with her condition. They take over shifts that she can't work because she is having a bad day. They pick up extra shifts or just help her in any way that she needs while working. She could not be at a better place or have better people around her that help her in her situation. She would like to go back to college to become an animal nutritionist, once we get this Gastroparesis a bit more under control, that is the goal. 

Ever since being diagnosed with Gastroparesis, Ashley's life has been severely restricted and trying to get her back to normal, everyday life has been difficult. With it being such a rare condition, there have been very few tests that have been developed to help deal with Gastroparesis. There is no known cure for this condition as of this date so only ways to live with this condition, is just to try and deal with the symptoms. There are several ways to deal with the symptoms, some better than others, such as a NJ tube or the more known feeding tube. Another way is getting a gastric neurostimulator. 

Let's talk about the NJ tube. The NJ tube, Nasojejunal tube, is a tube that runs from your nose, all the way down through your stomach, straight to the intestines. Where this works, it provides several complications. The first issue is that, well, it looks bad. You have to deal with a small tube hanging out of your nose. You get looks from people and deal with the same questions over and over again. It's a huge hit to self esteem. The other issues with a tube like this is that it doesn't always stay in place. The tube can get tangled on itself or back up and get stuck in the stomach instead of staying in the intestine. That would mean the food and/or medicine is not getting to where it needs to go. The patient would have to go back to the doctor's to get this fixed. You can see how this wouldn't be a preferred way to go. 

The other option would be to undergo surgery and get the gastric neurostimulator. This is used with more extreme cases and happens to be the route that my girlfriend took. For those that don't know what this is, it is pacemaker but for your stomach. It does the same thing that a stimulator does for one's heart, it just shocks the stomach. Here is an article by [Metronic](https://www.medtronic.com/us-en/healthcare-professionals/therapies-procedures/digestive-gastrointestinal/gastric-electrical-stimulation/education-training/about-the-therapy.html) that is the maker of these pacemakers. 

The way that we went about getting the neurostimulator was at the suggestion of her specialist doctor. We met with her surgeon back in October of 2019 to speak with her and see if this was the route that the surgeon also though was a good idea. When both the specialist and the surgeon agreed that this was the best option for her, we set up the operation date. Mid way through November, Ashley went under the knife and got the gastric neurostimulator placed. Before continuing, I want to address the side effects that can happen. One issue that can happen with skinnier patients is that the leads from the stimulator to the stomach can shock you because there isn't enough fat on the person to absorb the electricity. Ashley is one of such patients. After waking up from the surgery and the anesthetics from the surgery wore off, she was in extreme pain and no amount of drugs would fix the issue. For the next four hours she was in extreme pain to the point that she sounded like she was going through labor. At around 10:30pm, she finally was able to fall asleep and slept through most of the night. 

We went home the following day, which was a three hour drive from Seattle Washington back down to Vancouver Washington. The following week was terrible. No amount of medication would keep the pain at bay. We basically didn't sleep the following week and talked with many different doctors to try and figure out what the situation was. We finally drove back up to Seattle to get the device turned off to see if that would help with the pain, and it immediately went away. For the next month, we had the device turned off until she went under another surgery in December of 2019 to get her leads lined with more fat to deal with the shocking. 

While this did help immensely compared to the first surgery, but it wasn't enough. Her movement was still restricted because in certain positions she could feel the shocking more, laying on her side and stretching would set it off. She was still dealing with a decent amount of pain from day to day. Ashley's specialist doctor wanted to try and have her push through the pain and try to eat to get more fat on her, which we tried for the following two months. After trying this for two months, it didn't help at all. So the decision was made to undergo another surgery. This time, the leads were replaced with brand new ones, they went through her abdominal wall in a different spot, and they each got their own hole though the abdominal wall. 

This is where we are at in this journey. As I write this, Ashley is recovering at Virginia Mason Hospital in Seattle. So far, she is doing better pain wise compared to the last couple surgeries but only time will tell how much better she is doing. But now we have run into another issue, the Corona Virus that is breaking out here in Seattle. The hospital is in lock down and visitors are forbidden for surgical patients. While I agree that keeping these surgery patients as safe as possible is in the best interests of everyone, I hate that I can't be there for her. It kills me that she is stuck alone in a recovery room with just a tv and her phone to keep her entertained. We talk through SnapChat's video chat to try and entertainer her and keep her hopes up. 

Throughout this whole process, Ashley has been such a strong person. It really takes a lot of courage and strength to be able to push through day in and day out. To get up every morning and try her best to go to work as often as possible. Even fighting through little things such as eating when your body tells you it doesn't want to. I consider myself lucky to know her and to be apart of her life.
